        1. What was the first thing you paid attention to when interacting with
        the experience?
      </div>
      <div class="pinkbox">
        The use of colour was the first thing that immediately caught my eye.
        The bright, neon tones created a strong visual impact and set the mood
        for the experience from the get-go. The palette was both playful and
        energetic, and it kind of suggests that the website was more of an
        artwork or interactive website rather than a traditional portfolio. It
        creates a good first impression where it communicates personality and
        creative intent, before I even begin reading the text. It also hints at
        the type of designer behind the work; someone who values bold expression
        and wants their site to feel immersive rather than purely informational.

    <!-- As you can see, I'm using 4 of the main colour the website uses: cyan, hot pink, purple and yellow. I'm using these colour as well for this review for this assignment, using black as the overall background to create a contrast with those neon colours-->

        2. Spend two minutes with the experience and create a list of each of
        your discrete actions.
      </div>
      <div class="cyanbox">
        When I first arrived on the website, I moved my mouse around the landing
        section and quickly noticed that certain words changed when hovering
        over I skimmed through the introduction text while experimenting with
        the cursor movements. Then, I scrolled down and encountered a triangle
        graphic that also responded to movement, though it did not offer as much
        depth as I expected. Moving to the pixel displacement section (most
        visually striking and memorable moment of the site), I interacted with
        the pixel movement for a while. Finally, I reached the contact page,
        where I noticed additional hover effects and interactive elements on
        every text. After reaching the end, I actually scrolled back up to check
        if I had missed any other interactions (particularly on the last page
        where some animations weren’t obvious at first glance)

        3. What part of the experience did you spend the most time engaging
        with?
      </div>
      <div class="purplebox">
        I actually spent the most time on the first section of the website, the
        introduction or "about me" page. This was mainly because of the
        interactive words that changed when I hovered my cursor over them. I
        found myself experimenting repeatedly, moving the mouse across the text
        to see what new words would appear. This shows how even a small but
        playful feature can capture attention more effectively than larger
        visuals. It invites the user to participate actively rather than
        passively scroll.

        4. What was the most common action in your two-minute interaction with
        the experience?
        <!-- why paragraph you may ask? it's so the question and answer part can be distinguish easily -->
        <p>
          Moving my cursor around the screen was the most common action I did.
          Unlike traditional websites where scrolling or clicking dominates, the
          interaction here felt centred on hovering and exploring how the text
          or visuals responded to my movements. I found myself less focused on
          reading every single line of text and more on experimenting with where
          the cursor could uncover hidden responses. I think the designer
          intentionally made hovering the primary form of engagement,
          encouraging playful exploration.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="pinkbox">
        5. What is your impression of the intended primary goal of the
        interactive experience?
        <p>
          I’d say that the primary goal of this interactive experience is to
          show the designer’s creativity, technical skills, and their passion
          for building interactive websites. Rather than serving as a
          straightforward portfolio with project links and case studies, the
          site itself becomes the portfolio. It shows what the designer is
          capable of: immersing visitors in an interactive environment where the
          emphasis seems less on providing detailed information and more on
          leaving a strong impression of originality.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="cyanbox">
        6. How does the interactive experience communicate this primary goal?
        <p>
          The experience communicates its goal effectively through the use of
          consistent interactivity, bold visuals, and experimental effects. Each
          section includes a different form of interaction, from hover text to
          moving shapes and pixel effects. The strong colour palette and
          unconventional structure also communicate that this is not a typical
          website, but rather a showcase of creative identity. Palat2023
          demonstrates their ability to think beyond standard layouts and tools,
          aligning the medium with the message (making the site itself into a
          piece of digital art).
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="purplebox">
        7. What is your impression of how the experience should be interacted
        with over time? (For how long and how many different times)
        <p>
          I would say once or twice is enough. In my impression, this experience
          is designed to be short and impactful, meant to be explored once or
          twice rather than used as a resource people keep returning to. After
          the first visit, most of the ‘surprises’ will have already been
          uncovered. The site doesn’t have deep content or project links, so
          after exploring the interactions and maybe visiting the contact page,
          there isn’t much more reason to return (other than to revisit the
          visual effects or to use the contact page).
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="pinkbox">
        8. How does the interactive experience communicate how it should be
        interacted with over time?
        <p>
          The structure of the website itself communicates that it is a one-time
          exploration. The user smoothly scrolls through the linear design from
          introduction to contact without branching paths or additional
          navigation options. It suggests that the designer intends for users to
          view the site as a journey that begins and ends within one visit. In a
          way, the site positions itself more like a digital exhibition piece
          than a typical professional portfolio
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="cyanbox">
        9. What other media forms (digital or otherwise) does the experience
        reference?
        <p>
          The website feels like it was inspired by a few different kinds of
          media; digital art installations, glitch art, and experimental motion
          graphics. The bold neon colours and glitchy effects felt similar to
          digital art installations or music visuals (like distortions). Where
          the hover interactions (words change when you move the cursor)
          reminded me of experimental typography in design magazines or
          interactive poetry projects I’ve seen online.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="pinkbox">
        10. What does this reference/s communicate to you about how you should
        act when engaging with your research experience?
        <p>
          These references made me feel like I wasn’t just supposed to “read”
          the website the way I would with a regular portfolio. Instead, I felt
          encouraged to play around; hover over things, and explore without
          worrying too much about following a strict order. It felt less like
          looking for information and more like being in an interactive gallery
          where curiosity drives how you move around. There also aren't any
          pointers or signs whatsoever. The design shows that I was meant to
          interact, test, and almost “perform” my way through the site by moving
          the mouse and seeing what happened.

        11. What does this reference/s communicate to you about how you should
        feel when engaging with your research experience?
      </div>
      <div class="pinkbox">
        These references suggested that I should feel curious, playful, and even
        a little surprised while going through the site. The glitch effects plus
        bold colours gave off a sense of excitement, while the hidden hover
        interactions made it feel like there were secrets waiting to be
        uncovered. So rather than being serious/professional, I’d say the site
        wanted me to lean into experimentation and discovery, which created a
        fun, almost game-like atmosphere.

        12. What is the most frustrating part of the interaction to you and what
        makes that part frustrating?
      </div>
      <div class="purplebox">
        There wasn't a particularly frustrating part that I could think of,
        maybe just the triangle interaction, which initially looked like it
        could offer deeper or more complex interactivity, kind of turned out to
        be relatively limited. I expected clicking or dragging might do
        something additional/ different, but it only followed the cursor in a
        basic way. Probably the lack of links to actual projects also felt like
        a missed opportunity (cause I was curious to see more of the designer’s
        work). But I guess it’s just a mismatch between expectation and
        delivery.

        13. What is the most satisfying part of the interaction to you and what
        makes that part satisfying?
      </div>
      <div class="cyanbox">
        I really liked the pixel displacement effect in the middle section. It
        was visually striking, smooth in its motion, and felt like a technical
        highlight compared to the other features (hence the most satisfying
        part). Unlike the triangle, it delivered on the expectation of a
        memorable creative moment. Watching the distortion and seeing how it
        responded to my cursor movements. It stood out as the clearest
        expression of the site’s goals. Demonstrating technical skill while
        providing a unique, aesthetic experience that I would remember even
        after leaving the site.
