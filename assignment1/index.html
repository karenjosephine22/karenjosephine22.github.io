        1. What was the first thing you paid attention to when interacting with
        the experience?
      </div>
      <div class="pinkbox">
        The use of colour was the first thing that immediately caught my eye.
        The bright, neon tones created a strong visual impact and set the mood
        for the experience from the get-go. The palette was both playful and
        energetic, and it kind of suggests that the website was more of an
        artwork or interactive website rather than a traditional portfolio. It
        creates a good first impression where it communicates personality and
        creative intent, before I even begin reading the text. It also hints at
        the type of designer behind the work; someone who values bold expression
        and wants their site to feel immersive rather than purely informational.

        2. Spend two minutes with the experience and create a list of each of
        your discrete actions.
      </div>
      <div class="cyanbox">
        When I first arrived on the website, I moved my mouse around the landing
        section and quickly noticed that certain words changed when hovering
        over I skimmed through the introduction text while experimenting with
        the cursor movements. Then, I scrolled down and encountered a triangle
        graphic that also responded to movement, though it did not offer as much
        depth as I expected. Moving to the pixel displacement section (most
        visually striking and memorable moment of the site), I interacted with
        the pixel movement for a while. Finally, I reached the contact page,
        where I noticed additional hover effects and interactive elements on
        every text. After reaching the end, I actually scrolled back up to check
        if I had missed any other interactions (particularly on the last page
        where some animations weren’t obvious at first glance)

        3. What part of the experience did you spend the most time engaging
        with?
      </div>
      <div class="purplebox">
        I actually spent the most time on the first section of the website, the
        introduction or "about me" page. This was mainly because of the
        interactive words that changed when I hovered my cursor over them. I
        found myself experimenting repeatedly, moving the mouse across the text
        to see what new words would appear. This shows how even a small but
        playful feature can capture attention more effectively than larger
        visuals. It invites the user to participate actively rather than
        passively scroll.

        4. What was the most common action in your two-minute interaction with
        the experience?
      </div>
      <div class="pinkbox">
        Moving my cursor around the screen was the most common action I did.
        Unlike traditional websites where scrolling or clicking dominates, the
        interaction here felt centred on hovering and exploring how the text or
        visuals responded to my movements. I found myself less focused on
        reading every single line of text and more on experimenting with where
        the cursor could uncover hidden responses. I think the designer
        intentionally made hovering the primary form of engagement, encouraging
        playful exploration.

        5. What is your impression of the intended primary goal of the
        interactive experience?
      </div>
      <div class="cyanbox">
        I’d say that the primary goal of this interactive experience is to show
        the designer’s creativity, technical skills, and their passion for
        building interactive websites. Rather than serving as a straightforward
        portfolio with project links and case studies, the site itself becomes
        the portfolio. It shows what the designer is capable of: immersing
        visitors in an interactive environment where the emphasis seems less on
        providing detailed information and more on leaving a strong impression
        of originality.

    <div class="outerthree">
      <div class="pinkbox">
        6) How does the interactive experience communicate this primary goal?
      </div>
      <div class="purplebox">
        The experience communicates its goal effectively through the use of
        consistent interactivity, bold visuals, and experimental effects. Each
        section includes a different form of interaction, from hover text to
        moving shapes and pixel effects. The strong colour palette and
        unconventional structure also communicate that this is not a typical
        website, but rather a showcase of creative identity. Palat2023
        demonstrates their ability to think beyond standard layouts and tools,
        aligning the medium with the message (making the site itself into a
        piece of digital art).
