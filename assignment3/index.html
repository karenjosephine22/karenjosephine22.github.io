    <!-- I chose Caprasimo for the headings and Caveat for the body text 
    I want to create a sense of rhythm and personality that reflects the musical and cultural theme
    of the website. Caprasimo’s bold, rounded forms bring energy and visual rhythm.
    In contrast, Caveat’s handwritten style adds a warm, human touch, making the information 
    feel more personal and expressive. -->

    <h2>a journey through sound</h2>
    <!-- Discovery through sound. 
     So for this project the idea is to 
     The use of hover and click actions makes the experience feel intuitive and immersive 
     the hover state builds anticipation as colour gradually appeare (curiosity and attention), 
     while the click action completes the journey by revealing each instrument’s sound and story. 
     The cyclical navigation back to the main gallery encourages continued exploration, 
     reflecting how people naturally engage with music: by observing, listening, and connecting. 
     a clean, sensory experience that feels both educational and emotionally engaging. -->
